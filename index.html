	<h2>Music üéµ</h2>
	<p>
		I started music 2 years ago with a friend. Even though it was for fun at the beginning, it became important to me because it allows to have real projects to focus on outside of my studies. Today I already have 2 singles available on the streaming platforms, which is something I'm very proud of.

		<h3>Basketball üèÄ</h3>
	<p>
		I've been playing basketball for almost 4 years now. I wish I had discovered this sport sooner because it really became my passion. I play basketball 3 or 4 times a week : outside with my friends but also with Ieseg's team. Thanks to this sport, I developed different skills, such as leadership or perseverance.

	<h4>Sport üèÖ</h4>

	<p>
		Sport is probably the most important thing to me. I exercise almost everyday, by going to the gym, or using what I have at home. It is essential for me to exercise regularly. It is good for my physical health of course, but also for my mental health, as it creates a feeling of pride or accomplishement.
